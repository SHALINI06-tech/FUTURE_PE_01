ðŸŽ¥ **Prompt Engineering Task 1 â€” AI-Generated Marketing Video**  
As part of my internship at Future Interns, I explored how to creatively use AI tools to generate a marketing video from scratch.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
This task helped me understand prompt engineering not just as a technical skill but as a creative storytelling process. I used a mix of AI tools to bring an imaginary magical school to life â€” inspired by Misty Valley Academy of Magical Arts.
